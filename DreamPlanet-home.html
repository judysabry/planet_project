  <p> <span class="indent"> </span><strong>You definitely know that they have a long, long story!</strong> In summary, they had a beautiful planet, and then it got occupied, so they had to leave and go to another planet. They transformed this planet into an amazing place we see. Then, after they saw a white hole, in summary, it's the opposite of a black hole, and it brings them a human. They save the human, return it home, and then a note from the humans gets to them. After the aliens fight because of their diverse opinions, but when they saw a human and a Jovian playing together, the aliens are named Jovians, did you know that? So after they agree, and this is how Vacanata is the amazing place it is today.</p>
  <p> <span class="indent"> </span><strong>Your wondering about the jovians well they are like us.</strong> They are just a little bit you know diffrent in looks and have diffrent achievments. They live in a Democratic goverment so it the magority vote that counts.They also haave the same govermental problem they some times chose the worst electricals and it even cost their previous planet. So you know life not perfect but it is not unfixable if we just work a little all of these  things are achevable like the Jovians.</p>
  <p> <span class="indent"> </span><strong>Well I told you about the Jovians and their cool but that doesn't mean we just leave Earth.</strong> Earths a beautiful place but lately it getting sick from all the pollution it's been getting. <strong>We sometimes say that it won't matter if i do one small act it impacts for the worse or the better but when you throw garbage it is deffintly for the worse. bye bye üëã! Thank you for listening.</strong></p>
